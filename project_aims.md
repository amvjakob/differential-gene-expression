We are interested in the differential gene expression of patients with/without autism. We are also interested in how the gene expression profiles of patients with/without autism differ at certain age groups. we have found two datasets [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE25507), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE18123) from two different studies that explore highly similar variables (gene expression of 54613 genes, age, control vs. autism).

The [1st](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE25507) dataset is limited in information compared to the [2nd](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE18123)) dataset, so the bulk of our primary analysis will be performed on the 2nd dataset, while the 1st dataset can be used to verify the predictive modelling generated from the 2nd dataset. We will use normalization methods to ensure our comparative analysis of both datasets is consistent. The primary study from the 2nd dataset has suggested that certain genes are significantly correlated with disorders associated with autism, we can analyze and verify whether this set of genes is also observed in the sample patients with autism from the first dataset. We will conduct PCA on gene expression profiles in the 2nd dataset to identify variability as well as to explore possible batch effect of the data since 2nd dataset contains information on sample batches. We can apply clustering in the gene expression samples to see if the identified groups correspond to control patients and patients with autism.

Both datasets did not look at the significance of sample patient age affecting gene expression profiles, even though the 2nd dataset acknowledged that patient age at blood draw significantly influenced different gene expression levels of certain genes. We could rebuild a prediction model based on the 2nd dataset, but also factor in subgrouping samples into different age groups. Statistical methods involved in building our new prediction model can include linear regression and logistic regression (because our response will only have two values - control vs autism). Building our new prediction model can also involve machine learning tools (ie. random forest algorithm) to help us verify the results of our prior clustering analysis. Our prediction model can also be verified by predicting control vs autism of the samples in the 1st dataset to test the sensitivity and accuracy of our model.
